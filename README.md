Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis financial is looking to modernize its operations and wants to do so adhering to current or best security software and practices. Our job was to identify and refactor vulnerabilities discovered.


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Half of the battle for me personally was solving some unusual errors with eclipse, on one occassion it took me 4 hours to get the IDE functioning correctly and about 40 minutes to complete the assignment. The security suite itself is fairly straightforward to use, assuming you stick to the guidelines. Find and and patch vulnerabilities,
review code for good practices, correct where none are found. Good coding is an integral part of software security, an unreviewed or poorly coded system can introduce a ton of vulnerabilities to a system.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Patching certain vulnerabilities via updating was problematic. Specfically one individual update gave me a significant amnount of problems and I wasnt able to find out why, the rest of the patches went through fine. Probably im not familiar enough with coding in java and utilizing maven.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Patching out found vulnerabilities via updating. Utilizing cryptography to enhance connection security via https. In the future I would continue to use javas built in key gen and the maven vulnerability check system.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Rerun the maven dependency build. Which did infact introduce other vulnerabilities that required patching.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Using maven. Other then that the biggest issue was learning to utilize a new IDE in a new language and attempting to solve for security issues would generally be a very poor practice. I would struggle to think of any scenario where a very large company would desire someone unfamiliar with a codeing language or IDE to take point on fixing all known vulnerabilites.
THe biggest lesson would perhaps be that I need to be highly competent at utilizing Java, eclipes, and maven, and then beggining to solve for security issues. It did present a very steep learning curve, and I find that you generally dont want to stack the odds against yourself in areas of critical importance.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Because of the above mentioned reasons, im not totally sure. This course more than anything shows competency in being able to solve a plethora of new problems and critical thinking skills under extreme time constraints. It could be used as a show piece for capability to learn and adapt under pressure as oppossed to actual skill in vulnerability testing.
8 week semesters generally provide for only enough time to scratch the surface of a topic.
